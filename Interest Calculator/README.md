This small application just calculates the interest rate of a late payment of a bill. This is just to test the conditionals in Java

# How it works:
# Install the program
You download the file and run it on Node. You need first to install the libraries on Node to allow the data input. You need to install the Json.js file together and place it in the same directory where this file is located.

# Run the file:
Run the file using the command node interestcalculator.js or via Windows/Linux. When you run the file it just asks you about your name and how much is the bill. It also asks you how many days are in default. 
If you are less than 15 days of default, the bill will added with 5% more of the face value. 
If the bill is more than 15 days in default, it will add 10% of the face value. It also shows a message if the face value is 0 and no days in default.
